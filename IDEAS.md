# Ideas for Future Versions

This document tracks feature ideas and enhancement proposals for roadmap-gen future releases.

## üöÄ Roadmap v0.4.0 - Feature Ideas

After analyzing the current project, here are the priority features for version 0.4.0:

### üîí **Top Priority: Internal/Public Content Control**

A critical feature for organizations: the ability to create roadmaps with different visibility levels.

**Use Case**: Teams need to share roadmaps externally (clients, partners, public) while keeping sensitive information (internal costs, technical details, risks) private.

**Implementation**:

```yaml
# Project level
- name: 'Secret Project Alpha'
  internal: true  # Entire project hidden without --with-internal

# Quarter detail level
quarters:
  Q1-2025:
    status: 'in-progress'
    description: 'Public description'
    details:
      - 'Public milestone'
      - text: 'Internal technical debt cleanup'
        internal: true  # This detail hidden without flag
    costs: '50k‚Ç¨'
    internal_notes: 'Budget concerns, team morale issues'  # Hidden by default
```

**CLI Usage**:

```bash
# Public roadmap (default)
roadmap-gen -s roadmap.yaml

# Internal roadmap with sensitive data
roadmap-gen -s roadmap.yaml --with-internal
```

### üì± **Suggested Priorities for v0.4.0**

#### **Phase 1 (Core Features)**

1. **Internal/Public Content Control** - Mark projects or quarter details as internal-only
2. **PDF/PNG Export** - High-demand feature for reporting and presentations
3. **Tags & Filtering** - Essential for large roadmaps with many projects
4. **Watch Mode & Preview** - Dramatically improves development experience
5. **Print-friendly Theme** - Critical for stakeholder meetings and documentation

#### **Phase 2 (Advanced Features)**

6. **Basic Gantt View** - Alternative visualization for project timelines
7. **Interactive Search** - Real-time filtering for large datasets
8. **Project Dependencies** - Visualize project relationships and blocking issues
9. **GitHub Issues Import** - Streamline workflow integration

### üí° **Future Considerations (v0.5.0+)**
